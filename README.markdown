vim-autoformat
==============

This vim plugin integrates external code-formatting programs into vim.
If you have installed a supported formatprogram correctly, it will integrate with vim automatically.


How to install (Vundle)
-----------------------
Put this in your .vimrc

```vim
Bundle "Chiel92/vim-autoformat"
```

How to use
----------
To be able to use automatic code formatting, you have to install an external program that can format code of the programming language you are using.

If you have done that, you can format visually selected code with ```gq```.
For more info type ```:help gq```.
You can also format the whole buffer by calling the function ```g:Autoformat()```.
For convenience it is recommended that you assign a key for this, like so:
```vim
noremap <F7> :call g:Autoformat()<CR><CR>
```


Supported formatprograms
------------------------
* einars/jsbeautify for javascript (has to be installed as a pathogen-compatible plugin)
* autopep8 for python (must be globally available)

If you find yourself in need of support for another formatprogram, simply add a configuration file in the folder ```ftplugin```.
You can take the existing ones as an example.
Oh, and be sure to send me a patch. :)
